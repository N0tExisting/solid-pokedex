yarn install
```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

The page will reload if you make edits.

#### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
