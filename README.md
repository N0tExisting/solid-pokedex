A Pokedex built using [Solid.js](https://solidjs.com) and the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/)

## Development

### Installing

We use [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) to manage dependencies, to install run:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
